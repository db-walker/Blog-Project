        <p>I have found that in my artistic journey, what you spend on supplies and materials will not make you a great artist. There are so
            many different art supplies to invest in. For example, coloring pencils can be found all over
            the place. There are so many brands out there to choose from. I have used a few of the inexpensive
            brands with great results and have also used a more premium brand that made a big difference in the final image. However, if I did not know
            how to blend colors and properly mix them together, that would have shown no matter what brand was used.
            Having experience and knowledge plays a major part in having great artwork but buying the right items can help you achieve the outcome you are looking for. 
            It is safe to say that art supplies are just tools. It is all about your dedication, consistency, and knowledge. </p>
        <p>You can still get great supplies without breaking the bank, so a few things to consider when buying your next batch of supplies are:
            <ul class="questions">
                <li class="q1">What is it that you want to create?</li>
                <li class="q2">What do you need to achieve the end goal?</li>
                <li class="q3">Will it be worth the money?</li>
                <li class="q4">Reviews! (reading others accolades and gripes about a product can have a great impact)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Great art supplies are only a portion of what it takes to be a great artist.
            They only aid you in your journey and can help make it alot easier but they dont define
            you as an artist. A pack of pens from your local dollar store can even make something look
            great!
